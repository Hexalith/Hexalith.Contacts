# Hexalith Contacts - Domain Layer

The Domain layer is the core of the Hexalith Contacts project, containing the essential business logic and domain models. This layer is independent of any external concerns and focuses on representing the business concepts and rules.

## Structure

The Domain layer is divided into several projects:

1. `Hexalith.Contacts.Domain`: Contains the main domain entities and aggregates.
2. `Hexalith.Contacts.Domain.Abstractions`: Contains abstractions and value objects used across the domain.
3. `Hexalith.Contacts.Events`: Contains domain events raised by domain entities and aggregates.

## Key Concepts

### Value Objects

Value objects are immutable objects that describe characteristics of domain entities. They don't have an identity and are compared based on their attributes.

#### Person

The `Person` record represents an individual's basic information:

```csharp
public record Person
{
    public Person(
        string name,
        string firstName,
        string lastName,
        string birthDate,
        Gender gender)
    {
        // Constructor with validation logic
    }

    public string Name { get; init; }
    public string FirstName { get; init; }
    public string LastName { get; init; }
    public string BirthDate { get; init; }
    public Gender Gender { get; init; }

    public bool IsValid()
    {
        // Validation method to ensure data integrity
    }
}
```

The `Person` record now includes:
- A constructor with parameter validation to ensure data integrity
- An `IsValid()` method to check the validity of the Person object
- Comprehensive XML comments explaining the purpose and usage of the class and its members

This approach ensures that Person objects are always created in a valid state and can be checked for validity at any time.

#### Gender

The `Gender` enum represents the possible gender values for a person:

```csharp
public enum Gender
{
    Undefined = 0,
    Female = 1,
    Male = 2,
    Other = 3
}
```

#### ContactPointType

The `ContactPointType` enum represents the various types of contact points:

```csharp
public enum ContactPointType
{
    Phone = 1,
    Email = 2,
    PostalAddress = 3,
    SocialMedia = 4,
    Other = 0
}
```

#### ContactPoint

The `ContactPoint` record represents a single point of contact for a person or entity:

```csharp
public record ContactPoint(
    string Name,
    ContactPointType PointType,
    string Value
);
```

### Entities and Aggregates

(Add information about main entities and aggregates in the domain)

### Domain Events

The `Hexalith.Contacts.Events` project contains domain events that represent important occurrences within the domain. Some examples include:

- `ContactAdded`
- `ContactDescriptionChanged`
- `ContactDisabled`
- `ContactEnabled`

These events are used to communicate changes in the domain state to other parts of the application.

## Code Documentation

All key classes, enums, and methods in the Domain layer are thoroughly documented using XML comments. This documentation provides detailed explanations of:

- The purpose and usage of each class and enum
- The meaning and expected values of properties and parameters
- Any important implementation details or constraints

For example, the `Person` record includes comments explaining the purpose of each property, the use of the constructor for validation, and the importance of the `IsValid()` method.

Maintaining and updating these comments is crucial for the long-term maintainability and understandability of the codebase. When making changes to the domain model, always ensure that the corresponding documentation is updated to reflect those changes.

## Best Practices

When working with the Domain layer:

1. Keep the domain models and logic pure and free from infrastructure concerns.
2. Use value objects for concepts that don't have a distinct identity.
3. Implement domain entities as rich models with behavior, not just data holders.
4. Use domain events to communicate significant state changes within the domain.
5. Ensure that the domain layer remains independent of other layers in the application.
6. Maintain comprehensive and up-to-date documentation for all domain concepts.
7. When adding new classes or modifying existing ones, follow the established documentation patterns.
8. Implement validation logic in constructors and provide methods to check object validity.
9. Use immutable objects where possible to ensure data integrity.

## Testing

The domain layer should be thoroughly unit tested to ensure the correctness of business rules and logic. Test cases should cover various scenarios and edge cases for each domain concept.

When writing tests, consider using the XML comments as a guide for creating comprehensive test cases that cover all documented behaviors and constraints. For value objects like `Person`, ensure that:

- The constructor correctly validates input and throws appropriate exceptions for invalid data.
- The `IsValid()` method correctly identifies valid and invalid states.
- All properties are correctly set and retrieved.
- The immutability of the object is maintained.
