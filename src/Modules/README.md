# Hexalith Contacts - Modules

The Modules directory in the Hexalith Contacts project contains the implementation of different components of the application, separated into client, server, and shared modules. This modular approach allows for better organization, separation of concerns, and potential for reuse across different parts of the system.

## Structure

The Modules directory is divided into three main projects:

1. `Hexalith.Contacts.Client`: Client-side implementation
2. `Hexalith.Contacts.Server`: Server-side implementation
3. `Hexalith.Contacts.Shared`: Shared components used by both client and server

## Hexalith.Contacts.Client

The Client module contains the implementation of the client-side functionality of the application. This could include:

- User interface components
- Client-side state management
- API communication services
- Client-side validation

Key components:
- `Services/`: Contains client-side services for API communication, state management, etc.
- `Modules/`: May contain feature-specific modules or components

## Hexalith.Contacts.Server

The Server module contains the implementation of the server-side functionality of the application. This typically includes:

- API endpoints
- Server-side validation
- Integration with external services
- Data access and persistence logic

Key components:
- `Application/`: Server-side application services
- `Infrastructure/`: Data access, external service integrations
- `Presentation/`: API controllers, middleware

## Hexalith.Contacts.Shared

The Shared module contains components, models, and utilities that are used by both the client and server modules. This promotes code reuse and ensures consistency between client and server implementations. It may include:

- Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
- Shared validation logic
- Utility classes and helper functions
- Shared configuration

Key components:
- `Configurators/`: Shared configuration logic
- `ContactBaseTypes/`, `ContactElements/`, etc.: Shared models and logic for different domain concepts
- `Security/`: Shared security-related components
- `Resources/`: Shared resources like localization files

## Best Practices

When working with these modules:

1. Maintain a clear separation of concerns between client, server, and shared code.
2. Use dependency injection and interfaces to keep modules loosely coupled.
3. Ensure that the shared module doesn't depend on client or server-specific implementations.
4. Keep the shared module focused on truly shared concerns to avoid unnecessary coupling.
5. Use consistent naming conventions and structure across all modules.
6. Implement proper error handling and logging in both client and server modules.
7. Write unit tests for each module, and integration tests for client-server interactions.

## Testing

Each module should have its own set of tests:

- Client: Unit tests for components, services, and state management. Consider using tools like Jest and React Testing Library for React-based applications.
- Server: Unit tests for services and controllers. Integration tests for API endpoints and data access.
- Shared: Unit tests for shared models, utilities, and validation logic.

Additionally, end-to-end tests should be implemented to test the full stack, from client UI to server persistence.

## Deployment

- Client: Typically bundled and served as static files, possibly through a CDN.
- Server: Deployed to a server or cloud platform capable of running the server application.
- Shared: Compiled into both client and server deployments as needed.

Ensure that your deployment process includes proper environment configuration for each module.
